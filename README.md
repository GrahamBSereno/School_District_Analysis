# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The school board has notified relevant personnel that the reading and math grades for Thomas High School have been altered. The purpose of this analysis is to replace the math and reading scores with the accurate data while preserving data integrity. The next task is to analyze the school district data for spending and academic trends prior to and after the change.

Results:
- How is the district summary affected?
  - As shown below, the district summary is not significantly effected by the change. This metric takes into account the entire district, so the removal of one ninth grade class from one school only slighlty reduces the average math score, passing math rate, and overall passing rate.
